# The Library API (TLA)

This API is used for an example project implementing an API for a library. The idea is to discuss different API-design-decisions and play with different implementations or tools.

The functionality is limited:

There could be different items than can be borrowed, like books, ebooks, games, DVDs, magazines (currently these are limited).

- adding users
- adding customers
- listing/searching for items 
- borrowing items
- returning items
- managing item stocks
